# Building a Scrolling Bot for Scraping Tweets

## Description

In this project, we are going to build a Bot using Python and Selenium 3, in order to scrape [Twitter](https://twitter.com)'s feed related to a certain keyword.  
We'll basically get each tweet's username and text.

## Output Datasets

In the data folder, we'll have a single csv file that contains the tweets.

## Setup & Run

Run the following command for running the bot in the background:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 scripts/main.py
```

Alternatively, you can check the notebook file for running the bot step by step, and visualize it's actions.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.10
- pandas
- selenium 3
